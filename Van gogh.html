            <div class="description">
                <p>Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade, he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of which date from the last two years of his life.</p>
                <p>His work is characterized by bold colors and dramatic, impulsive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. Van Gogh's best-known works include "Starry Night," "Sunflowers," and "The Bedroom."</p>

            <p><b>Starry Night, 1889</b></p>
            <p>The view that we see in Starry Night is actually inspired by the view that Van Gogh saw from his bedroom in the asylum. The swirling blues of the moonlit night sky have become synonymous with the artist’s style and the emotional quality of his use of color. </p>

            <p>He wrote that for him sunflowers represented “gratitude” and so hung one of them in his home. Later, his friend and fellow artist Paul Gaugin said that he very much liked the works and asked Van Gogh for one of the paintings, which he was given. Today, this copy sits in the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam.</p>

            <p>Many consider this painting as foreshadowing Van Gogh’s suicide and representing the isolation he felt throughout the years. It is made even more poignant by the fact it was painted in the weeks leading up to his death.</p>

            <p><b>The Bedroom in Arles, 1888</b></p>
            <p>The bedroom depicted is Van Gogh’s. It shows his simple furniture, using contrasting colors – although scientific research shows that the colors we see today are the result of discoloration through time. The lack of perspective was intended by the artist as a means of flattening the volumes to resemble a Japanese print. Of this painting, Van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo saying, “In short, looking at the painting should rest the mind, or rather, the imagination.”</p>
